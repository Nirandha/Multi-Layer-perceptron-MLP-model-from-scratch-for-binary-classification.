# Multi-Layer-perceptron-MLP-model-from-scratch-for-binary-classification.
Multi Layer perceptron (MLP) model from scratch for binary classification.
The aim of the project is to build a Multi Layer perceptron (MLP) model from scratch for binary classification. That is given an input 
 output the associated class label 
 or 
.

In particular, we will classify images of handwritten digits (
). For example, given a set of handwritten digit images that only contain two digits (Eg: 
 and 
) the model will classify the images based on the written digit.

For this we will use the MNIST dataset (collection of 
 images of handwritten digits) - you can find additional information about MNIST here.
